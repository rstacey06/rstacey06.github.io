  This one stated off shakey, I was feeling good than ran into a few road blocks I coulnd't get around. After seeking some technical support from classmates it was made clear that I bit off more than I could chew. My original idea was a bit more complex that I realized, so I needed a new idea and fast! As a video game nerd I've always needed a better way to organize my games to see what I have (other than rifling through all of them), so I decided to create one. Doing this I would still be able to use multipule models and active record to store my data, to achieve my goals. 
	
  I started off making tables using SQL for my Users and Games models while establising relationships between the two ( my Users model 'has many games' and my Games model 'belongs to' the User). Next came my controllers, I ended up with 3 of them to help set up my routes, one for each model and an app contoler that housed my helpers and route to my homepage. The CRUD(create, read, update, delete) and RESTFul concepts really came in handy at this point, helping me create my Routes and actually bringing this web app to life. With some guidence from my peers I was able to get my app up and running.
	
 Finally came adding a little flair to my project. This was a little intimidating, seeing as I've never used CSS, only briefly reading about it in our previous lessons. It was a bit overwhelming at first to see all the diffrent ways you can style and edit your web app. After again seeking out some advice from my peers I was given a great link that helped walk me through the process. 
 
 Coming from being compleatly lost to restarting on the fly and being able to create a web app using all these new concepts and ruby gems was overall very rewarding.
