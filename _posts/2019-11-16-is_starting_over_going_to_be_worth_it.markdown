It was the burning qustion on my mind when I was deciding to take the leap into Software Engineering. Mainly because I already had an established busniess in marketing, it was difficult for me to just let that go after all the hard work that was put into it. Plus business was good how do you turn your back on that? Unfortunatly at the end of the day i just wasn't satisfied, I felt I needed to be challenged again.

I had always thrown the idea around with my wife that I'd love to go back to school further my education and learn a new skill, but never really thought anything would come of it. Then one evening at dinner she implored me to just do it, saying " What's it going to hurt to try?" So that evening I went home and did my research and the next day I found myself getting lost into the Flatiron School  free software engineering bootcamp.

After a couple of days dabbling around i had the realization of "Hey, I'm being challenged again!". It was at that moment I knew software engineering was for me! 

Now here we are 6 weeks later I'm a 14 days into the Flatiron School Software Engineering program, doing some thing i never thought I'd do, write code and starting over. Shortly into the program I another realization that writing code will give me that challenge I've missing every single day. 

Needless to say, it was woth it!
