To think only a month ago I could only out put a very minuscule amount of data in Ruby, and today I finished my very own CLI Gem.  Countless hours of studing and practicing writing code in ruby have finally come full circle. When first given the task of wrting my own CLI Gem I was extremely anxious, " Where do I start, How do I set up an eviorment, are you sure you can do this?". 

Coming up with an idea was the easy part. My wife and I love to travel, often starting our vacation planning with a National Park selection, so why not create something to help us with that? Making a CLI Gem of National Parks, being able to go to one place picking a State and getting all of its parks and park info was a no brainer. But now came the anxity driven part, where to start?

Listing out step by step what i needed to do to get the ball rolling came next. I needed to set up my environment, some of my class mates that had done it before I had made it seem like it was some exausting process so natually i was nervous. After relizing it was just download times that made it a long process made it a breeze, it also did hurt that I run a MacBook Pro (which i highly recomend). So with my environment set up next was the real "how do I even start moment". Staring at a blank page was extremely intimidating but I just thought back to my recent labs and a video I watched ( Daily Deals, Avi is incredible) made this next step a little easier. 

There I was directory made, bundler and Gems installed, all the frame work was right in front of me! Now to write my code.
Here's where all thoes hours of class and studing paid off, writing Class/ instance methods, iterating through collections, using basic control flow and instantiation, etc. I'd be lying if I said it went smoothy, there was a lot, and I mean A LOT, of trial and error, but thanks to some great classmates and cohort leads I was able to finish my CLI Gem with a great deal of pride.
