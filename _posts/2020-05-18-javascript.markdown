What is it? Honestly you can't get too far into web development without running into it, and if you're reading this chances are your looking for answers. Well you've come to the right place because I've got them. It can seem like a daunting task trying to learn JavaScript but I'm here to tell you, YOU CAN!

  When coding in JavaScript you also need to be fluent in HTML and CSS. HTML is the basic structure of your site, the core of every web page. This includes headers, text, images or anything you want to include. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content for the web. Now CSS dictates how the HTML elements of a website appear on screen. This is what allows you to customize fonts, color, background, etc. Think of it as HTML is the canvas and CSS is the paint.
	
	So what do we even need JavaScript for then you might be asking, first is adding interactivity to our website. If you want your website to be more than just a static page of text you need some JavaScript. Its also not just for websites, its used in creating mobile apps as well. Have you ever played a game directly in your web browse? JavaScript! So how does it work you maybe asking, it's either embedded into our web page OR it's included in a .js file in your text editor. It also gets downloaded to a sites visitors' computer then processed( client-side language).
	
	To sum it up JavaScript it a scripting language used to create and control dynamic web content, such as interactivness and/or anykind of changes on your screen with you having to reload the web page(sldeshows, auto text, interactive forms, etc.). Another way to think about it is when you type only a couple letters into your search bar and it automatically fills the rest of the word for you or your twitter thread auto updating, thats JavaScript! It may seem like something simple, but these two actions show the power of JavaScript.
